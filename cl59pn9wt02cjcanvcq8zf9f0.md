## Discord Bot with Command Handler

Hello everyone üëã, I am Atharva Deshpande and this is my second article on developing discord bots.

In this article, we will understand how to use a command handler in a discord bot and the new slash commands. This article is built upon my previous article "[Discord Bot with Slash Commands](https://atoo.hashnode.dev/discord-bot-with-slash-commands)", hence it is recommended to go through it once.

This would be a very short and quick read as there aren't a lot many changes involved.

Here is the link to [Github Repository](https://github.com/Atoo35/slashcommand-discord-bot-tutorial-hashnode/tree/command-handler). You can go ahead and get the code directly but I would recommend reading through the article once.
> Note: Make sure you are on the `command-handler` branch before cloning.


## **Prerequisites**

- Familiar with the process of creating bot in the developer portal.
> Note: Do not forget to select `applications.commands` while generating invite link.

- Any code editor. ( I would be using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) )

- Basic understanding of Javascript

- Machine with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.15.0 installed.

- Quick read of [Discord Bot with Slash Commands](https://atoo.hashnode.dev/discord-bot-with-slash-commands)


## **Writing the code**

1. Altering the structure a little bit.
    Create a new folder called `slashCommands` in the root directory of your project. Move the `hello.js` command inside the folder. Your updated structure should look like this.

2. Changing the `deploy-commands.js` file
    ```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const { REST } = require('@discordjs/rest');
const { Routes } = require('discord-api-types/v9');
const commands = [];
const commandFilesDir = ['']
const deploySlashCommands = async (arrayDir) => {
  const rest = new REST({ version: '9' }).setToken(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);
  const applicationId = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_ID'
  const guildId = 'YOUR_GUILD_ID'
  arrayDir.forEach(dir => {
    const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(`./slashCommands/${dir}`).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));
    for (const file of commandFiles) {
      const command = require(`./slashCommands/${dir}/${file}`);
      commands.push(command.data.toJSON());
    }
  })
  // This commented code should be uncommented if you want to deploy the commands globally in all the servers
  /* rest.put(Routes.applicationCommands(applicationId), { body: commands })
  .then(() => console.log('Successfully registered application commands.'))
  .catch(console.error);
  */
  // Comment this if you are deploying commands globally
  rest.put(Routes.applicationGuildCommands(applicationId, guildId), { body: commands })
    .then(() => console.log('Successfully registered application commands.'))
    .catch(console.error);
}
deploySlashCommands(commandFilesDir);
```

    Replace the `applicationId` and `guildId` variables with the correct values.
    Here, we added a small loop to iterate over an array and fetch the file just like we used to do it before.
    ```javascript
arrayDir.forEach(dir => {
     const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(`./slashCommands/${dir}`).filter(file => file.endsWith('.js'));
         for (const file of commandFiles) {
          const command = require(`./slashCommands/${dir}/${file}`);
          commands.push(command.data.toJSON());
         }
})
```

    We are passing an array when calling the function 
    ```javascript
deploySlashCommands(commandFilesDir)
```

  This `commandFilesDir` is defined at the top with a blank entry like `['']`, indicating that the commands are directly located inside the `slashCommands` folder and not in another sub-folder.

    Now you can run the command `node deploy-commands.js` and it should run successfully.

3. Migrating events
    
    Create an `events` folder at the root level and in that folder create a file `interactionCreate.js`.
>Note: Please make sure the file name is exactly the same as above.

    Your project structure should look like this
    ![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657117624638/ObYHBLnvN.png align="left")

    Copy paste the following code inside `interactionCreate.js` file.
    ```javascript
exports.run = async (client, interaction) => {
     if (!interaction.isCommand())
        return;
      const command = client.slashCommands.get(interaction.commandName);
      if (!command)
        return;
      try {
           command.execute(client, interaction);
      } catch (error) {
          console.error(error);
          return interaction.reply({ content: 'There was an error while executing this command!', ephemeral: true });
      }
};
```

    It is the same code we have inside `index.js` where we listen for the `interactionCreate` event. Since we have moved the code here, we can remove the code from `index.js`.

4. Reading commands and events in `index.js`

    Copy-paste the below code in `index.js`. It is almost the same as before with a small change in the way we listened to the commands and the events.
    ```javascript
const fs = require('fs')
const { Client, Collection, Intents } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS] });
client.slashCommands = new Collection();
const readSlashCommands = (arrayDirs) => {
      arrayDirs.forEach(dir => {
        fs.readdir(`./slashCommands/${dir}/`, (err, files) => {
          if (err) return console.log(err);
          files.forEach(file => {
            if (!file.endsWith(".js")) return;
            let props = require(`./slashCommands/${dir}/${file}`);
            console.log("Successfully loaded " + props.data.name)
            client.slashCommands.set(props.data.name, props);
          });
        });
      });
}
readSlashCommands([''])
client.on('ready', async () => {
      var memCount = client.guilds.cache.reduce((x, y) => x + y.memberCount, 0);
      console.log(`Bot has started, with ${memCount} users, in ${client.channels.cache.size} channels of ${client.guilds.cache.size} guilds.`);
})
fs.readdir('./events/', (err, files) => {
      if (err) console.log(err);
      files.forEach(file => {
        let eventFunc = require(`./events/${file}`);
        console.log("Successfully loaded " + file)
        let eventName = file.split(".")[0];
        client.on(eventName, (...args) => eventFunc.run(client, ...args));
      });
});
client.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN);
```

    The function `readSlashCommands` works on the very same logic as we wrote in the `deploy-commands.js` file. Similarly, we are listening to the events such as `interactionCreate` via the code: 
    ```javascript
fs.readdir('./events/', (err, files) => {
      if (err) console.log(err);
      files.forEach(file => {
        let eventFunc = require(`./events/${file}`);
        console.log("Successfully loaded " + file)
        let eventName = file.split(".")[0];
        client.on(eventName, (...args) => eventFunc.run(client, ...args));
      });
});
```

    which is very much similar to the command read code.

    You can now run the respective command to start the bot and the console should look something like this.

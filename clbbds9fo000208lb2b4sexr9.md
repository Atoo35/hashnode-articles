# Upload a file to Pinata

Hello everyone üëã, I, Atharva Deshpande am back with another article. This article focuses on creating a very simple app that uploads files to [IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Here is the link to [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Atoo35/pinata-file-uploader). You can go ahead and get the code directly but I would recommend reading through the article once.

# Prerequisites

*   Basic knowledge of Blockchain and IPFS.
    
*   Any code editor. ( I would be using [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) )
    
*   Basic understanding of Javascript
    
*   Machine with [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
    

# Introduction

### IPFS

IPFS is a way of storing and sharing files on the internet in a decentralized way. Instead of using a single server or central authority to host files, IPFS uses a network of computers to store and distribute files. This means that anyone can access and share files on the network without needing to go through a central server or authority. IPFS also uses a special kind of addressing system, which means that files are identified by their content, rather than by their location. This makes it possible to access files on the network without knowing where they are stored, which can make it more efficient and resilient than other ways of storing and sharing files online.

# **Let's BUIDL It üõ†Ô∏è**

### Step 1: Pinata Account Setup

*   Head over to [Pinata](https://app.pinata.cloud/) and create an account
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670277022224/DEKNDV_EC.png align="left")
    
*   Login to the account and click on "Developers" on the top NavBar.
    
*   Click on "New Key", create an API key and copy the secret as you will not be able to look at the secret again.
    

### Step 2: Write some code üíª

*   Type in the command below in the terminal.
    
    > Note: `pinata-uploader` is the name of the project that I have put. You can put it anything you like.
    
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest pinata-uploader
    ```
    
    Select "No" when the prompt asks you for using Typescript in the project and hit enter.
    
    This is how your terminal would look after successful creation of the Next.js project.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670277516299/Ajs1xfQWm.png align="left")
    
    Open the project in VSCode using the command
    
    ```bash
    code pinata-uploader
    ```
    
    By running the command `npm run dev` you should be able to see the default UI provided by Next.js at [localhost](http://localhost:3000).
    

*   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and put in your API key and API Secret as below.
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670277971397/THhlMcgtS.png align="left")
    
    Save the file and head over to `next.config.js` in the root folder and replace it with the following.
    
    ```javascript
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      reactStrictMode: true,
      env: {
        API_KEY: process.env.API_KEY,
        API_SECRET: process.env.API_SECRET
      }
    }
    
    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```
    
    > NOTE: Don't forget to load these env variables using the command `source ./.env` in Linux/macOS terminal.  
    
    Finally, we would be now writing the main code which deals with Pinata.
    

*   Go to `pages/index.js` and replace the `Home` function with the following
    

```javascript
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <input type='file' onChange={(e)=>setFile(e.target.files[0])}></input>
      <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload</button>
      <ul>
        {
          pinnedFiles && pinnedFiles.map(file => (
            <li key={file.id}>
              <a href={`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/${file.ipfs_pin_hash}`} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>{file.metadata.name}</a>
            </li>
          ))
          
        }
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

On saving the file you will get some error related to `handleUpload` function not existing. Let's fix that:

Write a simple function defition which does nothing

```javascript
const handleUpload = async () => {
}
```

When you save this, you will get another error. Add the following line to solve it

```javascript
const [pinnedFiles, setPinnedFiles] = useState([])
```

You should now be able to see a very bad UI with a simple upload button and file selector.

Let's make these things work.

*   Since we would be dealing with Pinata APIs, we would need to install `axios` by typing the command `npm i --save axios`
    
*   Define a Pinata Config variable like this
    
    ```javascript
    const pinataConfig = {
        root: 'https://api.pinata.cloud',
        headers: { 
          'pinata_api_key': process.env.API_KEY,
          'pinata_secret_api_key': process.env.API_SECRET
        }
    };
    ```
    
*   Create a test function to check if we are indeed able to make the API call.
    

```javascript
const testPinataConnection = async() => {
    try {
      const url =`${pinataConfig.root}/data/testAuthentication`
      const res = await axios.get(url, {headers: pinataConfig.headers});
      console.log(res.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
}
```

Call this function on page load using the `useEffect` function.

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
    testPinataConnection()
});
```

Open the developer tools and head over to console to see a success message from pinata. If you don't see any message then recheck all the steps we did above very carefully.

By far, your `index.js` should look like this

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head'
import Image from 'next/image'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
import axios from 'axios'

export default function Home () {
  const [pinnedFiles, setPinnedFiles] = useState([])
  const [file, setFile] = useState(null)
  const handleUpload = async () => {
  }

  const pinataConfig = {
    root: 'https://api.pinata.cloud',
    headers: {
      'pinata_api_key': process.env.API_KEY,
      'pinata_secret_api_key': process.env.API_SECRET
    }
  };

  const testPinataConnection = async () => {
    try {
      console.log(pinataConfig)
      const url = `${pinataConfig.root}/data/testAuthentication`
      const res = await axios.get(url, { headers: pinataConfig.headers });
      console.log(res.data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    testPinataConnection()
  });

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <input type='file' onChange={(e) => setFile(e.target.files[0])}></input>
      <button onClick={handleUpload}>Upload</button>
      <ul>
        {
          pinnedFiles && pinnedFiles.map(file => (
            <li key={file.id}>
              <a href={`https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/${file.ipfs_pin_hash}`} target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>{file.metadata.name}</a>
            </li>
          ))

        }
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Now let's get to adding the functionality of actually uploading a file to IPFS. We will update the `handleUpload` function to this.

```javascript
  const handleUpload = async () => {
    try {
      if (file !== undefined) {
        const formData = new FormData();
        console.log(file)
        formData.append('file', file);
        const pinataBody = {
          options: {
            cidVersion: 1,
          },
          metadata: {
            name: file.name,
          }
        }
        formData.append('pinataOptions', JSON.stringify(pinataBody.options));
        formData.append('pinataMetadata', JSON.stringify(pinataBody.metadata));
        const url = `${pinataConfig.root}/pinning/pinFileToIPFS`;
        const response = await axios({
          method: 'post',
          url: url,
          data: formData,
          headers: pinataConfig.headers
        })
        console.log(response.data)
        queryPinataFiles();
      } else {
        alert('select file first')
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
  }
```

You would notice the `queryPinataFiles` function being called inside, but we haven't yet defined it. Let us define the function body.

```javascript
const queryPinataFiles = async () => {
    try {
      const url = `${pinataConfig.root}/data/pinList?status=pinned`;
      const response = await axios.get(url, pinataConfig);
      console.log(response.data.rows)
      setPinnedFiles(response.data.rows);
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
    }
  };
```

Save the file and head over to your app and keep the network tab open.

Choose any file and press upload to pin it to IPFS. You would see a network call to IPFS being made and once it is successful you would get an IPFS hash in the Response section of the Request. This implies that you have successfully uploaded your file to the network.

One final thing which is remaining is loading the files you uploaded on start of the app. Simple call the `queryPinataFiles` function in the same `useEffect`

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1670279695982/cHxeC-Ugm.png align="left")

There are all your files pinned to IPFS. Click on the filename to see the actual details

VOILA YOU HAVE DONE IT!!!
